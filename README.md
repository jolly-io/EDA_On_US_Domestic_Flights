## The Rationale

There are a variety of factors that impact the efficiency of an airlines' operations. Efficiency losses for airlines amount to more than revenue losses in the short and long run. It is therefore in the interest of airlines operators to understand these variety of issues that impact their operations, gain and leverage insights lead to efficiency gains, reduce costs and grow their bottom lines.

In this project, I undertook Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand delays in flights and reliability of airports. Given the dataset, I formulated and posed specific insight eliciting questions and endeavored to answer these questions from the dataset leveraging the Pandas and Numpy libraries and relevant Visualization toolkits.
